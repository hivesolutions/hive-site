    <h1>CONSULTING</h1>
    <p>Don't you just hate average consulting? Some say if you're not part of the problem, and you're not part of the solution, there is good money to be made in prolonging the problem with bad consulting.</p>
    <p>We are a <b>new generation consultancy</b>: we keep things simple, eliminating unnecessary overhead to get straight to the point. We listen, we think, we make and we deliver.</p>
    <p>For us consulting is about being creative while keeping in mind the requirements and objectives proposed by the client.</p>

                    We really care about what our customers have to say, so we listen.
                    Not just by showing up for meetings, but by truly listening and working hard to
                    learn about each customer we work with.
