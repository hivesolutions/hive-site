    <h1>LABS</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to Labs.
        We are always fooling around with <b>new technology</b>.
        We enjoy eating our own dog food, but also love fiddling we other things smart people create.
    </p>
    <p>
        We hate messy technology stacks, and prefer a <b>clean, uniform solution</b>.
        That's why we re-implement a lot of existing technology.
        We dissect the best software out there, and create our own version, <b>working hard to make it a better one</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have learned a lot this way, and we believe it has made our products that much better because of that.
        Take a look at the <b>kind of things</b> we've played with.

                    Yodna is our idea for <b>online presence</b>.<br/>
                    More than a <b>personal web hosting service</b>, Yodna was designed to be the point of convergence for all your online personas (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Flickr, YouTube, Tumblr).<br/>
                    <br/>
                    We wanted Yodna to be simple but flexible, allowing to create a personal web page with the <b>least number of clicks possible</b>, while allowing customization for advanced users.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    We used HTML5 and CSS3 to create Yodna. We made it modular using Colony, and we were able to <b>plug it with an OpenID plugin</b> we had, making the service also work as an OpenID provider.

                    Take The Bill started as a challenge for building a minimal invoicing service with a team of <b>1 designer and 1 developer in 3 weeks</b>, using Colony.
                    We nailed it, and won the bet.
                    Alas, we didn't get that client.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Take The Bill was then reworked for our own needs to invoice customers.<br/>
                    The service features a social component, to allow users to <b>connect with and evaluate</b> business partners.
                    We called it <b>Social Invoicing</b>.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    We used HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, together with jQuery and our <b>own set of UI plugins</b> for jQuery.
                    In the server side we use the <b><a href="http://getcolony.com">Colony MVC stack</a></b>.<br/>
                    The iOS app leverages our <b><a href="https://github.com/hivesolutions/commons_ui_mobile">Commons Library</a></b>, to speed up development of mobile CRUD applications (as well as provide some pretty UI components).<br/>

                    Initially created for a deal-a-day website, Pecway is a modular payments gateway.
                    It provides <b>secure payments</b> while integrating with <b>untrusted parties</b>.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Pecway supports multiple payment methods, through <b>interchangeable modules</b>.
                    One example is the Portuguese <b>Multibanco system</b> which is supported through a Colony plugin that abstracts an official partner's API.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Pecway has a web front-end using HTML5, CSS3, and some JavaScript using jQuery.
                    We leveraged Colony plugins like the <b>SMTP client</b> (together with the <b>MIME plugins</b>) to send rich HTML e-mails and the <b>HTTP client plugin</b> to interact with the Pecway consumers.

                    The idea is to develop a robot plugin, which can then be deployed into a real-time arena and fight with other plugins.
                    The robot plugin API was made as simple as possible, to <b>enable a novice to quickly develop and deploy</b> his first Colony plugin using Panzerini.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    We built the game arena around our standard web toolbox (HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript).
                    We used some recent browser functionality like <b>WebSockets</b> for the game server to actively <b>push updates</b> to the game state to listening clients.
