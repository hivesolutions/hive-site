    <h1>MOBILE</h1>
    <p>
        Does your team need to be on the move? Do your systems keep up with the pace?
        Mobile applications have seen tremendous growth both in consumer and the enterprise markets, and
        why is that? Because we move!
    </p>
    <p>
        A lot of people really need to <b>move around to get things done</b>,
        but still lack the support of the information systems they leave at the office.
    </p>
    <p>
        Things don't have to be this way. We, at Hive Solutions, can help you create applications
        that help you provide your mobile workforce with the <b>resources they need to do their job</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We believe mobile applications are about making the <b>best out of your time</b>, about <b>not losing opportunities</b>,
        about being <b>connected to the world</b> at any time and even about enabling <b>automation of tasks</b> for which classical
        desktop applications just can't cut it: think about inventory stock counts, for instance.
