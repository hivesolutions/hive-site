        Omni is a <b>Software-as-a-Service/Cloud Computing service</b>, which helps you create and use modular applications for the web.
    </p>
    <p>
        We believe in a platform that can <b>adapt</b> to the current environment and provide the user with the perfect <b>seamless experience</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Omni is meant to be deployable and scalable; deploying Omni in a large environment should be as simple as in a small one (<b>unbelievably simple</b>). Omni was created to avoid typical administration problems associated with updating systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Updating Omni is <b>not</b> about <b>shutting down</b> the company and waiting for 10 hours, but simply applying the changes, without any shutdowns, reboots or refreshes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Omni can bring enormous value to your company by drastically lowering implementation times, <b>getting rid</b> of <b>unnecessary</b> system <b>downtimes</b>, <b>cutting</b> the <b>costs</b> spent with IT staff and <b>improving</b> the overall <b>user experience</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Omni currently hosts a number of different software components, namely, a <b>retail store management system</b> being used by our client stores.
